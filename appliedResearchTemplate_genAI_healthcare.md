### Evaluating Generative AI for Medical Applications: A Comparative Framework using Reference Augmented Generation

### Abstract

Generative AI (GenAI) holds immense potential for revolutionizing medical practice. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for comparing the performance of GenAI systems in diverse medical scenarios. The framework leverages Reference Augmented Generation (RAG) principles to ensure standardized evaluation across various tasks like diagnosis, treatment recommendations, patient communication, and emotional handling. A detailed methodology is outlined, encompassing data collection, AI system selection, prompt design, evaluation metrics, human expert correlation, and experimental setup. The analysis plan includes both quantitative and qualitative assessments, with a focus on accuracy, reliability, generalizability, and emotional intelligence. Additionally, the framework addresses ethical considerations regarding data privacy and bias detection. By outlining a rigorous and multifaceted approach, this paper aims to guide future research efforts in evaluating and optimizing GenAI for effective integration into medical settings.

### Introduction

The rapid advancement of Generative AI (GenAI) has sparked considerable interest in its potential applications within the healthcare domain. GenAI systems, capable of generating human-quality text, present exciting possibilities for assisting medical professionals in various aspects of patient care. These applications could range from diagnosing complex conditions to providing personalized treatment recommendations and improving patient communication.

However, a critical step towards realizing the potential of GenAI in medicine involves rigorous evaluation of these systems. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for comparing the performance of GenAI models across diverse medical scenarios. This framework builds upon the principles of Reference Augmented Generation (RAG), where human-annotated reference data is used to guide the evaluation process and ensure consistency.

The proposed methodology outlines a meticulous approach encompassing various aspects: data collection, selection of AI systems, prompt design, evaluation metrics, human expert correlation, and experimental setup. Furthermore, the methodology integrates ethical considerations related to data privacy and bias detection, promoting responsible research practices.

### Summary of Steps

This section provides a high-level overview of the key steps involved in the proposed framework:

1. **Data Collection**: Standardized medical documents (clinical guidelines, patient records, diagnostic manuals) and scenario-based prompts are utilized for evaluation. Scenarios are developed across various medical specialties to ensure comprehensiveness.

2. **AI Systems**: Selected GenAI models, such as ChatGPT-4 and Gemini, are compared. A brief description of their training data is provided.

3. **Prompt Design**: Prompts are carefully crafted to define the role for which the response is generated (e.g., patient, physician) and explore different phrasing and context variations to assess their impact on AI outputs.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**: A combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics is employed. Quantitative metrics leverage RAG principles, including reliability, accuracy, and generalizability. Additionally, emotional handling is assessed to evaluate the AI's capacity to manage social and emotional aspects of patient care. Finally, comparative analysis is performed by assessing AI responses against human expert recommendations.

5. **Human Expert Correlation**: A panel of medical professionals evaluates the AI responses using a predefined rubric focusing on completeness, accuracy, and appropriateness.

6. **Experimental Setup**: Standardized scenarios with specific clinical problems, patient histories, and emotional handling requirements are developed. Comprehensive documentation ensures reproducibility. Responses are then generated from the AI systems and human experts for each scenario.

7. **Analysis**: Quantitative analysis involves calculating various metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and consistency measures. Qualitative analysis includes expert review for clinical correctness and emotional intelligence assessment of AI responses. Comparative tables summarize the findings for easy interpretation.

8. **Ethical Considerations**: Data privacy protocols for anonymizing and securing patient data are described. Additionally, techniques employed for detecting and mitigating biases in AI models are outlined.

9. **Results and Discussion**: Key findings regarding the performance of each AI system across different metrics are presented. Strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations for improvement are discussed.

10. **Conclusion**: An overall assessment of the GenAI systems based on the evaluation is provided. Future work directions outlined to enhance the capabilities and integration of GenAI in medical practice.
